# Session 6: Calculating Binding Free Energy

This section of the workshop covers advanced methods for calculating the binding free energy of a protein-ligand complex. Two powerful and widely used techniques were explored: the end-state MM-PBSA method and the more rigorous alchemical BAR method.

## Projects in this Section

* ### [Part A: MM-PBSA Method](./A_mmpbsa_method/)
    * **Focus:** Calculation of the binding free energy (ΔG_binding) for the 1CEA protein-ligand complex using the Molecular Mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) method. This popular end-state method provides a computationally efficient estimate of binding affinity.

* ### [Part B: BAR Method (Alchemical Free Energy)](./B_bar_method/)
    * **Focus:** Calculation of ΔG_binding for the same 1CEA complex using the Bennett Acceptance Ratio (BAR) method. This is a rigorous alchemical free energy calculation involving simulations at multiple intermediate λ states to determine the free energy difference between two end states.
