# Session 5: Bio-Membrane MD Simulations

This section of the workshop focuses on the advanced techniques required to build, simulate, and analyze proteins embedded in a lipid bilayer. Due to the complexity of these systems, the session was divided into three distinct parts, each exploring a different type of membrane system.

All systems were built using the powerful **CHARMM-GUI** web server, which automates the complex process of membrane and protein setup.

## Projects in this Section

* ### [Part A: Simple Protein-Membrane System](./A_simple_bilayer/)
    * **Focus:** Simulation of a transmembrane protein in a standard, symmetric POPC lipid bilayer. This project covers the fundamental CHARMM-GUI workflow and the specific multi-step equilibration required for membrane systems.

* ### [Part B: Asymmetrical Bilayer with Glycolipids](./B_asymmetrical_bilayer/)
    * **Focus:** Building and simulating a more biologically realistic, asymmetric membrane containing different lipids and glycolipids in the inner and outer leaflets.

* ### [Part C: Membrane with a GPI-Anchored Protein](./C_gpi_anchored_protein/)
    * **Focus:** Handling proteins that are not transmembrane but are anchored to the membrane via a post-translational modification, such as a GPI anchor.
